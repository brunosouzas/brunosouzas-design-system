## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Colours only from tokens
Pieces SHALL take every colour from the generated tokens; `src/pieces/` holds no colour literal (`#` with three or six hex digits, `rgb(`, `hsl(`). A colour parameter SHALL be a token path of type `color`, such as `color.healthy`; any other value is rejected. Only `pipe.fill`, `lineBadge.fill` and `zone.fill` are data colours: they also accept `#RRGGBB` (see "Line colours from data"). Only `uiIcon.colour` also accepts `currentColor` (see "Current colour on UI icons").

#### Scenario: Source without literals
- **WHEN** the no-colour-literals test scans `src/pieces/`
- **THEN** it finds nothing

#### Scenario: Hex passed as a colour
- **WHEN** `pill` is called with `fill: "#FFFFFF"` or `fill: "outline.block"`
- **THEN** it throws a `RangeError` naming `fill` and saying a colour token path is expected

#### Scenario: Current colour elsewhere
- **WHEN** `pill` is called with `fill: "currentColor"`, or `lineBadge` with `fill: "currentColor"`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `fill`

### Requirement: Piece parameters checked
Each piece SHALL check its parameters before drawing and throw a `RangeError` naming the first problem: a missing or unknown parameter, a wrong JSON type, a non-finite or out-of-range number, an unknown enum value, or a colour that is not a token path (except "Line colours from data" and "Current colour on UI icons"). Sizes lie within 10000, counts and lists within the designs' limits, sizes leave room for insets; `road.d` and `pipe.d` take only path characters.

#### Scenario: Missing and unknown parameters
- **WHEN** each piece is called without one of its required parameters, and `pill` with an extra `colour`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming the missing parameter, and the `pill` call names `colour`

#### Scenario: Out of range
- **WHEN** `gear` gets `teeth: 3`, `serverStack` gets `units: 1.5`, or `sheet` gets a row with `lead: "star"`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `teeth`, `units` or `rows[0].lead`

#### Scenario: Sizes that would break the drawing
- **WHEN** `stamp` gets `r: 1`, `browserWindow` gets `width: 20`, or `folder` gets `scale: 1e307`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `r`, `width` or `scale`

#### Scenario: Smallest and largest accepted sizes draw valid geometry
- **WHEN** each piece is drawn with each bounded size parameter at its smallest and at its largest accepted value, the stickers also at `inkScale` 0.25 and 8
- **THEN** no drawn width, height or radius is negative and no value is infinite or NaN

#### Scenario: Too many repeated parts
- **WHEN** `steps` gets `count: 4294967296`, `gear` gets `teeth: 65`, or `rail` gets 51 nodes
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `count`, `teeth` or `nodes` before drawing

#### Scenario: Road path with something else
- **WHEN** `road` gets `d: "M0,0 L10,10\" onload=\"x"`
- **THEN** it throws a `RangeError` naming `d`

#### Scenario: Pipe path with something else
- **WHEN** `pipe` gets `d: ""`, `d: "L10,10"` or `d: "M0,0 L10,10\" onload=\"x"`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `d`

### Requirement: UI icons as data
The library SHALL hold `UI_ICONS`, the seven icons of `stackledger-map-and-link-pieces` design §5 (`sun`, `moon`, `zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `reset`, `calendar`, `download`), each with a title, a description and nodes in a 24 × 24 box without colours. `uiIcon({ name, x, y, size, colour })` SHALL place one in a group `translate(x y) scale(size / 24)` whose `fill` and `stroke` are `colour` (a token path, default `color.ink`, or `currentColor`).

#### Scenario: Default sun
- **WHEN** `uiIcon({ name: "sun", x: 0, y: 0 })` is called
- **THEN** its body is one group with transform `translate(0 0) scale(1)`, fill and stroke `#0A1033`, holding the sun's circle and its rays path

#### Scenario: The seven names
- **WHEN** the test lists `UI_ICONS`
- **THEN** the names are exactly the seven above, in that order, each with a non-empty title and description, and no node of the data carries a colour

#### Scenario: Unknown icon or a hex colour
- **WHEN** `uiIcon` gets `name: "menu"`, or `colour` `"#FFFFFF"`, `"currentcolor"`, `"inherit"` or `" currentColor"`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `name` or `colour`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Current colour on UI icons
`uiIcon` SHALL accept the exact keyword `currentColor` as `colour` and write it as is as the group's `fill` and `stroke`, with the same children as a token colour, so an icon inline in a page follows its element's text colour. No other spelling is accepted.

#### Scenario: Current colour
- **WHEN** `uiIcon({ name: "zoomIn", x: 4, y: 8, size: 16, colour: "currentColor" })` is called
- **THEN** its body is one group with transform `translate(4 8) scale(0.6666666666666666)`, fill and stroke `currentColor`, and the same children as `uiIcon({ name: "zoomIn", x: 4, y: 8, size: 16 })`

#### Scenario: Current colour on every icon
- **WHEN** each of the seven icons is drawn with `colour: "currentColor"`, written with `toSvg` and with `toReact`
- **THEN** no node holds a hex colour, every `fill` and `stroke` is `currentColor` or `none`, and the "Icons hold no link, style or script" rule holds for each tree

### Requirement: UI icon calls of 0.3.0 unchanged
Every `uiIcon` call valid in 0.3.0 SHALL draw the same tree and the same `toSvg` bytes as in 0.3.0.

#### Scenario: Frozen 0.3.0 icon calls
- **WHEN** the test re-calls the frozen fixture `test/fixtures/ui-icons-0.3.0.json`, written on `origin/main` (`2bfe4a5`) before any code: each of the seven icons with no colour at (0, 0), with `colour: "surface.dark.text"` at (0, 0), and with `colour: "color.white"` at (3.5, -2) with `size` 18
- **THEN** each of the 21 trees deep-equals its frozen tree and its `toSvg` output equals its frozen string
