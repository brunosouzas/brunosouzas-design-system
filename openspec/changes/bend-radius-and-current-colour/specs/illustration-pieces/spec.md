## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: UI icons as data
The library SHALL hold `UI_ICONS`, the seven icons of `stackledger-map-and-link-pieces` design §5 (`sun`, `moon`, `zoomIn`, `zoomOut`, `reset`, `calendar`, `download`), each with a title, a description and nodes in a 24 × 24 box without colours. `uiIcon({ name, x, y, size, colour })` SHALL place one in a group `translate(x y) scale(size / 24)` whose `fill` and `stroke` are `colour`: a token path (resolved to its hex, default `color.ink`) or the exact keyword `currentColor` (written as is, so an icon inline in a page follows its element's text colour).

#### Scenario: Default sun
- **WHEN** `uiIcon({ name: "sun", x: 0, y: 0 })` is called
- **THEN** its body is one group with transform `translate(0 0) scale(1)`, fill and stroke `#0A1033`, holding the sun's circle and its rays path

#### Scenario: The seven names
- **WHEN** the test lists `UI_ICONS`
- **THEN** the names are exactly the seven above, in that order, each with a non-empty title and description, and no node of the data carries a colour

#### Scenario: Unknown icon or a hex colour
- **WHEN** `uiIcon` gets `name: "menu"`, or `colour` `"#FFFFFF"`, `"currentcolor"`, `"inherit"` or `" currentColor"`
- **THEN** each call throws a `RangeError` naming `name` or `colour`

#### Scenario: Current colour
- **WHEN** `uiIcon({ name: "zoomIn", x: 4, y: 8, size: 16, colour: "currentColor" })` is called
- **THEN** its body is one group with transform `translate(4 8) scale(0.6666666666666666)`, fill and stroke `currentColor`, and the same children as `uiIcon({ name: "zoomIn", x: 4, y: 8, size: 16 })`

#### Scenario: Current colour on every icon
- **WHEN** each of the seven icons is drawn with `colour: "currentColor"`, written with `toSvg` and with `toReact`
- **THEN** no node holds a hex colour, every `fill` and `stroke` is `currentColor` or `none`, and the "Icons hold no link, style or script" rule holds for each tree
